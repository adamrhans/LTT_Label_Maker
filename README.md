# Lock, Tag, Try EID List & Danger Tag Maker
----
In my job as a process operator, we routinely were requried to lock out equiment for maintanance work. This process involved identifying our eqipment isolation points on an EID (Energy Isolation Device) list. Then tags would be created with the number, locked position, job scope, signature, and date of lockout. I wanted to be able to have a program that would allow the creation & retention of these list and tags so in the future they would be readily available with minimal effort. 

### Software Used:
Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word (Mail Merge)

### Objective:
- Create EID List and Trasfer information over automatically to a template for labels for quicker execution of LTT Packages.
- Be able to retain these packages for ease of use and future execution for time savings. 
- Be able to Print EID, Blind List, and Tags
- Danger Tag Labels needed to be printed on water proof label paper
